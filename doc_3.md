# Program 3: Reverse Traversal of Singly Linked List

## Data Structure Used
A singly linked list is implemented using a structure containing data and a pointer to the next node.

## Functions Implemented
- `reversePrint(struct node *head)`  
  Recursively prints the elements of the linked list in reverse order.

## main() Overview
The main function creates a singly linked list dynamically based on user input and demonstrates reverse traversal using recursion.

## Sample Output
Enter number of nodes: 4
1 2 3 4
Reverse traversal: 4 3 2 1

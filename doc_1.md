Stack Structure:

Has an array called 'items' to store characters (max size 100)
Has 'top' variable that points to the last element
When empty, top = -1
Basic Stack Functions:

initStack() - Makes a new empty stack
push() - Adds element to stack
pop() - Removes element from stack
isEmpty() - Checks if stack is empty
Helper Functions:

isOpeningBracket() - Returns true if character is '(', '[', or '{'
isClosingBracket() - Returns true if character is ')', ']', or '}'
isMatchingPair() - Checks if opening and closing brackets match
Main Function:

isBalanced() - Checks if expression has balanced parentheses Goes through each character Pushes opening brackets to stack Pops and matches closing brackets Returns true if stack is empty at end
MAIN METHOD ORGANIZATION

Print program header
Define three test expressions:
"a + (b - c) * (d"
"m + [a - b * (c + d * {m)]"
"a + (b - c)"
Check each expression and print result
End program
SAMPLE OUTPUT

BALANCED PARENTHESES CHECKER

Expression: a + (b - c) * (d Result: NOT BALANCED

Expression: m + [a - b * (c + d * {m)] Result: NOT BALANCED

Expression: a + (b - c) Result: BALANCED

Explanation:

First expression has unclosed '(' bracket
Second expression has mismatched brackets ('{' closed with ')')
Third expression has properly matched brackets

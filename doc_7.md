# Program 7: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

## Data Structure Used
A weighted graph represented using a cost adjacency matrix.

## main() Overview
The main function implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.

## Sample Output
Distance from 0 to 1 = 4
Distance from 0 to 2 = 7
Distance from 0 to 3 = 9

Question 8 Documentation: SORTING ALGORITHMS COMPARISON

Program that generates random numbers and sorts them using different algorithms. User chooses algorithm and sees performance statistics (comparisons and swaps).

PROGRAM FLOW

User enters N (how many random numbers to generate)
Program generates N random integers between 1 and 1000
Display numbers before sorting
User selects sorting algorithm (1-4)
Program sorts and counts operations
Display sorted numbers and statistics
SORTING ALGORITHMS

BUBBLE SORT

Compares adjacent elements and swaps if out of order
Repeats until no more swaps needed
Largest elements "bubble up" to the end
Performance:

Comparisons: Always n(n-1)/2
Swaps: 0 to n(n-1)/2 (depends on initial order)
Time Complexity: O(n²)
Simple but slow for large datasets
SELECTION SORT

Finds minimum element and places it at beginning
Repeats for remaining unsorted portion
Performance:

Comparisons: Always n(n-1)/2
Swaps: At most n-1 (only 1 swap per pass)
Time Complexity: O(n²)
Fewer swaps than bubble sort
INSERTION SORT

Builds sorted array one element at a time
Takes each element and inserts it in correct position
Shifts larger elements to make room
Performance:

Comparisons: Varies (fewer if partially sorted)
Swaps: Same as comparisons
Time Complexity: O(n²) average, O(n) best case
Efficient for small or nearly sorted data
MERGE SORT

Divide and conquer approach
Splits array in half recursively
Merges sorted halves back together
Performance:

Comparisons: ~n log n
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n) - needs extra memory
Much faster for large datasets
Stable sort (maintains order of equal elements)
HELPER FUNCTIONS

generateRandomNumbers():

Fills array with random integers from 1 to 1000
Uses rand() % 1000 + 1
printArray():

Displays array contents
Prints 10 numbers per line for readability
Each sorting function:

Takes array, size, and pointers for comparison/swap counters
Modifies array in-place (except merge sort uses temp arrays)
Updates counter variables during execution
COUNTING OPERATIONS

Comparisons:

Every time two elements are compared
Incremented in if conditions
Swaps:

Bubble Sort: actual element swaps
Selection Sort: only when minimum is moved
Insertion Sort: each shift counts as swap
Merge Sort: counts when element taken from right subarray
SAMPLE EXECUTION

Input: N = 15 Random numbers generated: [342, 867, 123, 456, ...]

User chooses: Merge Sort Result: [123, 123, 234, 234, 342, ...]

Statistics:

Comparisons: 43
Swaps: 8
Why Merge Sort is efficient:

Uses divide and conquer strategy
Reduces comparisons significantly for larger N
O(n log n) vs O(n²) for other algorithms
ALGORITHM COMPARISON FOR N=15

Bubble Sort: ~105 comparisons, ~50-60 swaps Selection Sort: ~105 comparisons, ~14 swaps
Insertion Sort: ~50-70 comparisons (varies), same swaps Merge Sort: ~43 comparisons, ~8 swaps

Note: For small N, difference isn't huge For N=1000, merge sort becomes dramatically faster

# Program 4: Doubly Linked List Operations

## Data Structure Used
A doubly linked list is implemented using a structure containing data, previous pointer, and next pointer.

## Functions Implemented
- `insertAfter(struct node *prevNode, int data)`  
  Inserts a new node after a given node.
- `deleteNode(struct node **head, struct node *del)`  
  Deletes a specified node from the list.

## main() Overview
The main function creates a doubly linked list, inserts a node after a given node, and deletes a node to demonstrate both operations.

## Sample Output
Doubly linked list operations performed successfully.

# Program 5: Graph Traversal Using BFS and DFS

## Data Structure Used
An adjacency matrix is used to represent an undirected graph.

## Functions Implemented
- `dfs(int v)`  
  Performs Depth First Search traversal starting from a given vertex.

## main() Overview
The main function accepts an adjacency matrix from the user and performs DFS traversal starting from vertex 0.

## Sample Output
Enter number of vertices: 4
DFS traversal: 0 1 2 3
